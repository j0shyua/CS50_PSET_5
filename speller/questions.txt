0.  Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a lung disease caused by inhaling
    fine particles of ash or sand dust.
    
1.  getrusage gets the resource usage measures from a specified user/program.

2.  There are 16 members in the struct rusage

3.  Before and after could be passed by reference instead of the value, because if you used
    the value of before and after, they would become copies of the values, which wastes space
    and time.

4.  After the program opens the text given in the command line arguments, it loops
    through each character. If the character is a letter or startes with apostrophes, it 
    is added to the array word[], and the index for the array increases, making sure the 
    word is stored correctly. If the index becomes greater than the defined LENGTH, the
    word is ignored, and index gets reset back to 0. If the word has numbers, it is also 
    ignored and index is reset to 0. Otherwise, the program has found a whole word, and
    the counter of words goes up. The function check(word) is called to see if the word 
    is misspelled. If it is misspelled, the counter misspelled increments, and the forloop
    continues looping.

5.  If we used fscanf instead of fgetc, we would need additional loops to see if the 
    string used had any number or other non-alphabetical characters. Additionally, fscanf returns
    the number of input items that matched the format specified. Numbers would be considered
    part of the string, and apostrophes would not be allowed.

6.  The parameters for check and load are constant because the word at the address for 
    check will not be changed while checking it. Similarly, the parameter for load is a
    constant because the dicitonary is not being changed/written to.
